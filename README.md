This R code creates a detailed scatterplot visualizing the relationship between corruption and human development across various countries using ggplot2. The dataset Economist_Assignment_Data is visualized, where the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) is plotted on the x-axis and the Human Development Index (HDI) on the y-axis, with data points colored by region. The plot starts with points represented as hollow circles (geom_point) and adds a smooth trend line (geom_smooth) for all data points. Key countries specified in pointsToLabel are annotated with text labels (geom_text) for emphasis. The visualization is then styled with a clean, minimalist theme (theme_bw), and axis labels, limits, and breaks are customized for clarity. The plot is finalized with a descriptive title and optionally styled using theme_economist_white from the ggthemes package, which aligns with the aesthetic of "The Economist" magazine. This results in a polished and professional chart that effectively communicates the interplay between corruption levels and human development across countries.
